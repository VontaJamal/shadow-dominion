# Grimoire 📖

**Open your grimoire. Learn anything. Remember everything.**

Grimoire is a flashcard system built around one idea: you should control exactly what you study and how you study it.

## What It Does

- **Create flashcards** and organize them into chapters, sections, or any category you define
- **Granular study sessions** — study Chapter 1 only, Chapters 1 and 3, or everything at once
- **Filter and sort** your cards however you need before a session starts
- **Spaced repetition** powered by Anki-style scheduling (SM-2 algorithm) — the cards you struggle with come back sooner
- **Make It Stick principles** baked into the review engine:
  - **Retrieval practice** — active recall over passive re-reading
  - **Interleaving** — mix topics to strengthen connections
  - **Spaced practice** — time between sessions is the feature, not the bug
  - **Elaboration** — prompts that make you explain *why*, not just *what*
  - **Generation** — attempt answers before seeing them
- **Hide cards** you've mastered — they stay in the system but leave your active rotation

## The Vision

Most flashcard apps make you do all the thinking about *how* to study. Shadow Dominion handles the science — you just make the cards and pick what to review. The system does the rest.

## The Stack

TypeScript · React · Next.js · Prisma · tRPC · Tailwind CSS · NextAuth.js

## Status

Early development. Foundation scaffolded, core architecture in place.
